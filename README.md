## Python AutoDownload Manager

A Python application to automate sorting of your downloaded files on MacOS. 

## Why?

Having recently made the switch from Windows to MacOS, I've found it mildly frustrating the number of things that I took for granted in a Windows system environment. Things like automatic file sorting on download, or individual application volume control are simply not available on Mac without:
1) High background memory usage (Looking at you Automator)
2) Paying USD $40 for volume control options (The trend being to pay for things that should be included as default functionality)

Therefore, I decided to simply build myself a working solution using Python and have it run as a low-memory, background process that starts up each time my laptop wakes.

## How Does it Work?

The Python script runs in the background passively and uses system logs to monitor whenever a file is downloaded into the default download folder. Once a download log has been detected, the script simply moves the file, according to filetype, to the desired location.

All you have to do is designate which folders you want which files to be sorted into!

## Want to run this file automatically on Startup on your MacBook?

  1. Create a ```.zh``` file and input the following (I use conda but if you don't, just exclude the conda lines from the ```.zh``` file.)

    #!/bin/zsh
    
    Set current directory to project folder containing script (ex. cd <path_to_project_folder>)
    Path to Python env manager (ex. source /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh) }
    Environment activation (ex. conda_activate <name_of_your_environment>)
    python auto_file_management.py
    
  
  2. Now that the shell script has been created (Step 1), follow these steps in order.
       * Create a shell script named as ```login.sh``` in your ```$HOME``` folder.
       * Paste the following one-line command into ```Script Editor```: 
         ```
         do shell script "$HOME/login.sh"
         ```
    
  4. Then save it as an Application.
  5. Finally add the newly created Application to your login items via the General Settings on your Macbook

  7. (Optional) If you want to make the script output visual, you can swap step 2 for this:
        ```
        tell application "Terminal"
          activate
          do script "$HOME/login.sh"
        end tell
        ```

  8. (Optional) If multiple commands are needed something like this can be used:
       ```
       tell application "Terminal"
         activate
         do script "cd $HOME"
         do script "./login.sh" in window 1
       end tell
       ```

## Considerations and Future Changelog

I started and built this relatively quickly just to get the functionality up and running without much thought to ease of use or distribution.

As such, in the future, I will be cleaning this up and creating a packaged version with pre-set defaults and better folder structure integrity(for example for verification and creation if a download location does not exist).
